    "The data cleaning for brands was extensive. Many people did not put the brand, but instead the product itself or the size of the product (operating in a foriegn country is hard). Moreover, even those who did input the brand spelled them in an astonishing number of ways. My approach for dealing with this was as follows. I manually looked through the data and found all of the variations in spelling. I then put this into a variations list. I then created a function, is_brand, which takes a string and a variation list and returns true if any of the variations are in the string. For each brand I was cleaning, I looped through all unique product strings and checked if they containted any variations of the brand using is_brand. If they did, I added the exact string to a list, which was then used as the input for pd.replace(). This proved to be an effective way of cleaning the strings, only not working with the brand 'ja' because if I searched for strings that contained that, I would also get strings like 'jasmine'. I handled this exception manually.\n",

In the end, I decided on keeping ~ 30 of the most common brands, and placed all others into an 'other' category (besides the 'no brand' and 'Bio' from before). I included strings in the variations list that ensured that all of the correct full strings would be picked up by the is_brand() function.

To get the final price, some gaussian noise is added to the product of the base price and each multiplier. \n",

All multipliers are real numbers greater than 0.\n",

    "We can see that the brand multipliers where generally normally distributed, with most of the mulitipliers between 0.7 and 1.4, with an outlier of 1.82, which was for the Bio brand. This indicates that organic food is more expensive by 1.8 times than the average non organi brand (not that this may have some bias with products that had organic versions being more expensive to begin with, but it did seem that there were Bio brands for many products). Other got almost 1, which makes sense as it was by far the most common brand, with a diverse range of products in it (both cheap and expensive) so it should be relativly neutral and dominating over others. The Lidl branded products were more expensive than average, while the Edeka and REWE branded where cheaper. Gut & Gunstig also appears to be a discount brand, as it had one of the lowest mutlipliers.\n",

This initally indicates that while there is some variation, the store location has less of an impact on product prices than the brand of the product and the brand of the store. We can see that Cape Town was cheaper than the other neighborhoods, but there were only 2 stores from Capetown and thus we don't have much data from there and the result could easily be due to random fluctuation. We can also see that Tempelhof had the most expensive stores, while Prenzluare Berg and Neukölln had the cheapest stores."

    "From the plot, we can see that there is no correlation between the rental prices in a neighborhood and the price multiplier from our model. This initially suggests that there is no correlation between rent prices and the price of groveries in that neighborhood. However, there were many simplifying assumptions that were made to make this model, namely grouping many grocery stores into larger neighborhoods and taking a rent price from a central place in the neighborhood. Not onyl that, but we have a rather small sample size, so I believe that further research is needed to determine if there is correlation between ent prices and the price of groceries."
